- **What is it:** Users can manage resource usage allocation of certain process
- **Authors:** Raymond Li
- **Spec Status:** Draft

## 1: Overview

### 1.1: Executive overview 

App Hammer is a tool that can help power users to easily manage resource allocations and tame the unwanted processes from eating up system resources to improve performance, reduce power consumption and fan noise.

### 1.2: Narrative / Scenarios

John is a tech-savvy PC user, who would like to take control of his PC performance through additional tuning. Sometimes he notices there are some processes consuming system resources that he thinks produce limited value to him. As a result, some other experiences that matter to him are impacted, such as increased fan noise, slower system responsiveness, worse gaming performance, shortened battery life, or slower video streaming speeds. He struggles to find a way to easily tame the undesired behaviors of the offending processes. 

He discovers a new tool to easily manage system resource usage allocation with additional knobs than existing surfaces, so the processes that provide limited value to him can be boxed. He can also be notified if certain processes eat up too much system resources, and let the tool to take care of them automatically based on the profiles he has set. He is delighted to see the experiences he cares about are now improved. Even better, through usage of the app, he and other users can inform Microsoft which experiences provide less value to them, so Microsoft could improve efficiencies of those experience in the future. 

### 1.3: Existing solutions and expectations 

#### 1.3.1: Task Manager

In the Details tab of Task Manager, users can kill a process, set process priority or core affinity. But it provides limited control when throttling resource usage, such as CPU, memory, disk, or networking. 

#### 1.3.2: Battle Encoder Shirase

[Battle Encoder Shirase (BES)](http://mion.faireal.net/BES/) is an open-source software that controls per-process CPU usage. With the tool, you can use other programs comfortably while doing something CPU-intensive in the background. 


### 1.4: Goals/Non-goals

#### 1.4.1: Goals

 - This feature will improve customer satisfaction and drive basic fundamental by allowing users to take action to improve their PC performance, reduce heat and fan noise, and increase battery-run time. 

#### 1.4.2: Non-goals

 - Although App Hammer will try to provide warnings and basic guardrails when the user tries to throttle critical processes, it does not guarantee app/system stability in all cases. The user should understand the risk of potential application errors, unexpected performance issues and system instability due to the usage of throttling certain key processes.
